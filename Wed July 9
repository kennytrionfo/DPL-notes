—————————— File outputs
uploading images or files that you can upload.
there are 2 types of resizing. resize to fit and resize to fill.
FILL WIll drop down both numbers until one of the w h numbers fills it. once it hits the new smaller image, the wider or taller side will just be cropped off. resize to fit means the entire photo will be sqeezed into the new space, but cuz it keeps it's aspect, it will have some empty space somewhere.
