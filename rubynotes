PSUDO CODE, CONDITIONALS,COMPARISON OPERTORS,

- How to create a file in atom from the terminal: First get out of irb if in it,
then type <atom "file name">
CONDITIONALS
- If some_condition
    do_stuff
  end
- False and Nill are the only two things in Ruby that equate to false.
Example if statement:
if my_age >20
  puts "Can go to club"
end
COMPARISON OPERTORS: =, =<, > +!,
CONDITIONAL OPERATORS:

VARIABLES, INSERTING INTO ARRAYS, HASHES

Assign: Find 5 methods for strings in Ruby: .chomp, .delete, .replace, .size, .scan
Assing: Find 5 methods for Fixnums/Integers: .even?, .zero?, .modulo, .abs, .to_s,

- use <numbers.map($:to_i) as a short way changing a string array to integers
- PUtting {<someting>} in a string is called interpolation.
- when you use single quotes, it will return EXACTLY what's between them so you can use things like String Interpolation cuz it will show up.
- two other data types beyond strings and fixnums. Arrays & Hash ( {} ) & ":" which is a symbol which is usually looks like :name or :bird & Time.
- Time.now gives us info on time:
: Time.now
 => 2014-05-22 11:57:54 -0600
- Can also use Time.now.year or Time.now.minute

- symbols are used a lot in hashes.
- symbol example:
me = {
:name => "Kenny",
:age => 40,
:age => "tall",
}
puts me[:name]
- add a property to the hash like: me[:sex] = "male"
- also can use {food: 'taco'} instead of {:food => 'taco'} for brevity.
- Convention is to use lowercase for symbols.
- Arrays are collections. you can iterate Arrays which means going over it one by one.
- In ruby you can assign anything you want to a var. So you can assign arrays to a var.
- each item in an array is called an index.
- : people.each do |person|
puts person
end
- : 2.1.2 :037 > things.each do |number|
2.1.2 :038 >     puts number * number
2.1.2 :039?>   end

- Ruby has 4 types of variables: see other note:
- Hash data types:
storage = {"Box 1" => "Stuff", "Box 2" => "More stuff"}
puts storage["Box 1"]
- each key needs to be unique but the values can be the same. still called indexes just not zero based.
- : storage.each_pari do |key, value|
puts "The key is #{key} and the value is #{value}"
end

IRB
- To get into irb  - <irb>
- 2.5 is a fixnums and is a float. a decimal is a float.
- in ruby, to get a float (decimal) use at least one decimal. ie.- 5/2.5=2.5
- Use <.class> at the end of a line to know what data type it is. ie- "kenny".class or 345.class or 2.5.class
- 5.downcase doesn't work cuz fixnums don't know how to downcase. each method only works with certain methods. fixnums don't work or udnerstand downcase. but strings know what they mean.
- "kennyT".reverse.upcase is method chaining. both can do their thing and upcase works on upcase cuz <"kennyT".reverse> becomes a new string that .upcase recognizes.
